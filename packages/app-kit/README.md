> Building blocks for Next.js apps that sign in against a JWT API through next-auth

Several apps sharing one API also share the code around it: the session plumbing, how a failed
request becomes a message a user can read, and the form controls on the sign in page. This package
holds that code once, so the apps install it instead of each keeping a copy.

## Install

```sh
npm install @sjolystinnovation/app-kit
```

The package ships TypeScript source, so add it to `transpilePackages`:

```ts
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  transpilePackages: ["@sjolystinnovation/app-kit"],
};
```

The components in `@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/ui` are styled with Tailwind CSS. Import the
package's stylesheet after Tailwind:

```css
/* src/app/globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/styles.css";
```

## Usage

Declare the values that differ between apps once, then pass that config wherever it is needed. One
app can define it, or several apps can each define their own.

```ts
// src/lib/session.ts
import { defineSessionConfig } from "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit";

export const sessionConfig = defineSessionConfig({
  jwtSecretEnvVar: "API_JWT_SECRET",
  loginRoute: "/en/login",
  draftStoragePrefix: "example",
});
```

```ts
import { resolveJwtSecret } from "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit";
import { sessionConfig } from "@/lib/session";

const secret = resolveJwtSecret(sessionConfig, process.env);
```

## API

### `SessionConfig`

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jwtSecretEnvVar` | `string` | Name of the environment variable holding the API JWT secret, such as `API_JWT_SECRET`. |
| `loginRoute` | `string` | Where an expired session sends the browser, such as `/en/login` or `/login`. |
| `draftStoragePrefix` | `string` | Prefix for the `localStorage` keys holding form drafts. |

### `defineSessionConfig(config)`

`(config: SessionConfig) => SessionConfig`

Returns the config unchanged, so TypeScript checks its shape where it is declared rather than at
every call site.

### `resolveJwtSecret(config, env)`

`(config: SessionConfig, env: Record<string, string | undefined>) => string`

Reads the secret named by `config.jwtSecretEnvVar`. Throws when that variable is unset or empty, so a
missing secret fails at startup instead of at the first token verification.

```ts
resolveJwtSecret(sessionConfig, { API_JWT_SECRET: "s3cret" });
// "s3cret"

resolveJwtSecret(sessionConfig, {});
// Error: Missing API_JWT_SECRET. The app verifies API session tokens with it.
```

The environment is a parameter rather than a read of `process.env`, which keeps Node types out of a
package that also runs in the browser.

### `formatApiError(error, fallback, statusMessages?)`

`(error: unknown, fallback: string, statusMessages?: StatusMessages) => string`

Turns a failed request into one line a user can read.

On a 4xx response it uses the first of:

1. The body's own message: a text body, such as the one `BadRequest("...")` sends from ASP.NET Core,
   or `message`, the first validation error or `detail` from a JSON body.
2. The entry in `statusMessages` for the status.
3. `title` from a JSON body. It ranks below `statusMessages` because ASP.NET Core sends a generic
   title, such as "Conflict", for every bare status result.
4. `fallback`.

On a 5xx response the entry in `statusMessages` comes first, then the body, then `fallback`. A 5xx
body can come from a proxy, such as "Bad Gateway", so the caller's own words win when it has them.

Key `0` in `statusMessages` covers a request that got no response, because of a dropped connection
or a timeout. Only text on a single line counts as a message. Axios's own message, such as "Request
failed with status code 500", is never shown, and a cancelled request gives `fallback`. Any other
`Error` gives its own message. A body requested as an `arraybuffer` or a `blob`, as for a file
download, is not read, so a failed download gets `statusMessages` or `fallback`.

```ts
try {
  await api.post("/users", form);
} catch (error) {
  setError(formatApiError(error, "Could not create the user.", { 409: "That email is taken." }));
}
```

### `Alert`

```tsx
import { Alert } from "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/ui";

<Alert variant="error">{message}</Alert>;
```

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `variant` | `"error" \| "success" \| "info" \| "warning"` | `"info"` | Colour of the box. |
| `role` | `"alert" \| "status"` | `"alert"` | Use `status` for text that keeps changing, such as a countdown, so a screen reader does not announce every change. |
| `className` | `string` | | Classes for placing the alert, such as a margin. Restyle it through the theme variables instead, since whether a clashing class wins depends on the order Tailwind emits them in. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | | Content. |

### `PasswordInput`

A labelled password field with a button that shows and hides the value. It also takes the other
`<input>` attributes, apart from `type`, which the component switches itself. `className` goes on
the outer element, see below.

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/ui";

<PasswordInput label="Password" name="password" required error={errors.password} />;
```

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | | Visible label, tied to the input. |
| `error` | `string` | | Message shown under the field. It turns the border red, marks the input invalid and is read out with it by screen readers. |
| `showPasswordLabel` | `string` | `"Show password"` | Accessible name of the toggle while the value is hidden. |
| `hidePasswordLabel` | `string` | `"Hide password"` | Accessible name of the toggle while the value is visible. |
| `className` | `string` | | Classes for placing the field, such as a margin. They go on the outer element around the label, input and error. Restyle the field through the theme variables instead. |

Pass the two toggle labels in the app's language. The defaults are English.

## Theming

The components draw every colour, corner radius and label size from theme variables with a light
default. Set any of them in the app's own `@theme` to restyle every component at once, or in a
selector such as `.dark` for a scoped theme:

```css
/* src/app/globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/styles.css";

@theme {
  --color-alert-error-bg: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 10%, transparent);
  --color-alert-error-text: var(--color-red-400);
  --radius-alert: var(--radius-xl);
  --color-input-focus-ring: var(--color-sky-500);
}
```

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `--radius-alert` | `var(--radius-lg)` |
| `--color-alert-error-bg`, `-border`, `-text` | red 50, 200, 700 |
| `--color-alert-success-bg`, `-border`, `-text` | green 50, 200, 700 |
| `--color-alert-info-bg`, `-border`, `-text` | gray 50, 200, 700 |
| `--color-alert-warning-bg`, `-border`, `-text` | amber 50, 200, 900 |
| `--text-field-label`, `--text-field-label--line-height` | `var(--text-sm)` and its line height. Set both together. |
| `--color-field-label-text` | gray 700 |
| `--spacing-field-label` | gap under the label, `calc(var(--spacing) * 1)` |
| `--color-field-required` | red 600, the asterisk on a required field |
| `--color-field-error` | red 600, the message under a field |
| `--radius-input` | `var(--radius-lg)` |
| `--spacing-input-y` | `calc(var(--spacing) * 2)` |
| `--color-input-bg` | `transparent` |
| `--color-input-border` | gray 300 |
| `--color-input-border-error` | red 400 |
| `--color-input-focus-border` | gray 300 |
| `--color-input-text` | gray 900 |
| `--color-input-placeholder` | gray 400 |
| `--color-input-focus-ring` | `var(--color-primary)` |
| `--input-focus-ring-width` | `2px` |
| `--color-input-toggle` | gray 400, the show password icon |
| `--color-input-toggle-hover` | gray 600 |

A default that points at another variable, such as `--color-input-focus-ring` at `--color-primary`,
is read once for the whole page. A scoped theme that changes `--color-primary` should set
`--color-input-focus-ring` in the same selector.

## Requirements

- Next.js 16, React 19, next-auth 4 and axios 1, as peer dependencies the app installs itself.
- For `@sjolystinnovation/app-kit/ui`: Tailwind CSS 4 and `@heroicons/react` 2. The focus ring uses
  the theme's `primary` colour unless `--color-input-focus-ring` is set.
- TypeScript with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. Relative imports here are extensionless, which
  `node16` and `nodenext` reject.

There is no build output. Shipping source is what keeps the `"use client"` directives intact, since
bundlers strip or relocate them. The consumer therefore compiles this source with its own
`compilerOptions`, and `skipLibCheck` does not exempt it.
